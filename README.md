OneTimePad is based on OTP Authenticator, a two-factor authentication App for Android 4.0+.

It implements Time-based One-time Passwords (TOTP) like specified in RFC 6238. Simply scan the QR code (or enter the setup code manually) and login with the generated 6-digit code.

This project was created for the purpose of "stock" inclusion within CopperheadOS and can also be found on F-Droid.

## Features:
- Free and Open-Source
- Requires minimal permissions
  - Only camera access for QR code scanning
- Encrypted storage on Android 4.3+
- Sleek minimalistic Material Design
- Great Usability 
- Compatible with Google Authenticator
- Manual setup (for devices where the camera is not available)
